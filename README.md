At some point in our lives as developers, we will have to work with concurrency. Concurrency is one of the most interesting topics in computer science, but also one of the most complicated to understand. 

And of course, implementing concurrent code is hard to maintain and debug. In Swift we have many ways to solve concurrent issues, but, we still require a lot of intuition to detect where is a potential bug around. 

However, that will change forever with the usage of Actors. Letâ€™s explore today how they work and how building concurrent code is now safer.
